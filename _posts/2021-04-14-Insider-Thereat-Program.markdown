An Insider Threat Program is establish to ensure safeguards and resources
Insider threat incidents are possible in any sector or organization. 
An insider threat is typically a current or former employee, third-party contractor, or business partner.

### Context

**Case Study 3: Theft of Intellectual Property**

A rogue nation sought to develop a next-generation trading platform for brokers and dealers. The rogue nation
conspired to steal the technology (design and code) developed by the Costa Rica financial services company. A
contractor (development manager) who had spent 15 years with that Costa Rica Company used a privileged
position to help the rogue nation. The financial impact of this incident is estimated to be in the billions of
dollars, and that does not factor in the consequent loss of competitive advantage for the firm.

**Assumptions:**

- The solution will require the team to think, develop and come up with recommendations for the case
using related technologies.
- The financial institution has limited monetary and human resources to detect and mitigate this
incident, they may rely heavily on the help that national and international police agencies could bring.
- Regulatory compliance and national laws could apply with this case
- Stakeholders will require a full overview of the case, with details regarding procedures and
recommendations to solve the incident.

**Other relevant details (background):**
- The contractor has no access to any other proprietary information regarding external projects besides
this one
- In order to win other business with the financial institution, another external vendor (a competitor for
the current contractor - from which the person involved with the incident was hired) offered their
services with a reduced cost to the financial institution, in order to help them to implement any
recommendation that the group of advisors will deliver.
- Currently, the financial company has several technology providers with multiple layers of
services, technical components, and heavily specialized personnel that will allow the financial
institution to implement any recommendations that you will have regarding the case.

### Why is important an Insider Threat Program 

- Reduced costs of an insider attack. An insider threat program maximizes your
chances to detect and deter an attack quickly, minimizing the damage an insider can
cause.
- Compliance with standards, laws, and regulations. NIST Special Publication 800-53,
NISPOM, the US National Insider Threat Policy, and Minimum Standards, and other IT
standards and regulations oblige organizations to develop and maintain insider threat
programs.
- Early detection of insider threats. Detecting insider threats is more challenging than
detecting outside attacks. An insider threat program helps spot a threat before it
becomes an attack and causes harm.
- Fast and efficient response to an insider attack. An insider threat program clearly
outlines the procedures, tools, and personnel responsible for mitigating a threat. With
this knowledge, employees can efficiently handle a cybersecurity incident.
- Encourage and incentivize correct behavior with training and awareness, policy and
procedure, and management practices.
- Should also deter, detect, and prevent people from wrongdoing
- Mitigate the impact(s) of the insider act through appropriate management or
enforcement actions
- Tailor their insider threat program and risk appetite to the organization’s unique
mission, culture, critical assets, and threat landscape.
- Build a culture of reporting and prevention that establishes and reinforces a
positive statement of an organization’s investment in the well-being of its people,
as well as its overall resilience and operational effectiveness.
- Employ multi-disciplinary capabilities that are enabled by technologies and/or
dedicated personnel based on the organization’s type, size, culture, nature,
business value, and risk tolerance to acts of malicious, negligent, or
unintentional insiders.
- Apply the framework of detecting and identify, assess, and manage for the
prevention of, protection against, and mitigation of insider threats.
- Establish a protective and supportive culture, protect civil liberties, and maintain
confidentiality.
- Assist organizations in providing a safe, non-threatening environment where
individuals who might pose a threat are identified and helped before their actions
can cause harm.

### Key Components of an Insider Threat Program

- Principles and standards that align the program with the culture and business of an
organization and describe its purpose, goals, and objectives.
- A prioritized list of critical assets, both physical and intellectual, that are essential to the
operation or business of an organization and whose compromise, damage, or loss can
have an adverse impact on its mission
- Definitions of the most significant and prevalent threats and how they could affect the
organization’s critical assets
- Means to detect and identify indicators of potential risks
- An Incident Response Plan in case of an insider threat incident
- A committee of stakeholders for program governance and leadership
- An organizational culture that encourages and provides a means of reporting; where
reporting potential threats, indicators, or concerns to a responsible party is a reasonable
expectation and confidentiality is maintained
- A central information hub for the collection, integration, analysis, and storage of all
elements pertaining to insider threats
- A threat management team for the assessment, response, and management of potential
insider threats

### What kind of activities could you do in an insider threat program?

- Identifies and focuses on those critical assets, data, and services that the
organization defines as valuable
- Monitors behavior to detect and identify trusted insiders who breach the
organization’s trust
- Assesses threats to determine the individual level of risk of identified persons of
concern
- Manages the entire range of insider threats, including implementing strategies
focused on the person of concern, potential victims, and/or parts of the
organization vulnerable to or targeted by an insider threat
- Engages individual insiders who are potentially on the path to a hostile, negligent,
or damaging act to deter, detect, and mitigate

### Frequently Used Tools and Activities to reduce the cyber threat

### Seven Phases of an Insider Threat Program 

#### 1: Prioritize and Scope

This Insider Threat Program Plan applies to all staff of the company, contractor, products, services, facilities, information, equipment,
networks, or systems

#### 2: Orient

Operational risk: usually in terms of frauds, cyber threats, information leakages, service disruptions, or system processing errors.
Security and Data Breach Risks Involving Personal Data The organization should be aware of potential security and data breach risks as
well as issues that may arise from them
Supply Chain Risk is associated with a lack of visibility into, understanding of, and control over many of the processes and decisions
involved in the development and delivery of cyber products and services

#### 3: Create a Current Profile

Organizational cybersecurity risk management practices are not formalized, and risk is managed in an ad hoc and sometimes reactive
manner. Prioritization of cybersecurity activities may not be directly informed by organizational risk objectives, the threat environment,
or business/mission requirements

#### 4: Conduct a Risk Assessment

The risk might harm the Costa Rican financial services company and the people who use its services. Would be affected in terms of
fraud, cyber threats, information leaks, service interruptions, or system processing errors.
Currently, the financial company has several technology providers with multiple levels of services, technical components, and highly
specialized personnel, who will evaluate the future recommendations that we will give in this audit.

#### 5: Create a Target Profile

#### 6: Determine, Analyze, and Prioritize Gaps

This Costa Rican financial services company is a neophyte in the development of cybersecurity measures but it is committed to
advancing in the Framework Implementation Tiers. For them, it has several technology providers with multiple layers of services,
technical components, and highly specialized personne

####  7: Implement Action Plan.

This company is committed to developing a culture of resilience, for the moment it will evaluate the Informative References indicated in
the framework.

For example Vendors Management - APO10 (COBIT2019)

Which indicates:

- Identify and evaluate vendor relationships and contracts.
-  Select vendors.
-  Manage vendor relationships and contracts.
- Manage vendor risk.
- Monitor vendor performance and compliance.
